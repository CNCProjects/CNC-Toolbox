CNC-Toolbox
===========

This is a CNC made toolbox that you can built with a small CNC machine like the ShopBot Handibot

The project is a derivitive of the Sketchup model that is found here:

To cut this you will need a piece of baltic birch plywood that is exactly 1/2" thick (make sure you check it with calipers) The sheet size will need to be at least 48" wide and 42" tall.

The Sketchup model (3d) is included here. To cut this I took that model and I laid it out flat and then I exported it to DXF so that I could later import it into VCarve to setup my toolpaths.

The DXF file is already included.

The toolpaths are setup to be cut on a Handibot using 6"x6" tiles. In the cutting files folder you will find every tile that is needed to cut it out, along with a map that shows each tile number and where it coresponds to the design.

To use a Handobot, you will need to index it EXACTLY at every 6" across, and up to cut this file. Shopbot is releasing a jig that can help you with this. Either that, or you can come up with a jig solution of your own.

With the Handibot, you have to cut about 60 tiles, and you have to load each file individually. To make that process easier, I have included a script in the cutting files folder that you can load. This script will zero out the tool and load one file after another automatically, give you a chance to pause and move to the next tile.

This file makes it immensely easier to cut a large amount of tiles like this.
